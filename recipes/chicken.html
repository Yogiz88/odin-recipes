<h3>World's Best Smoked Chicken Breasts</h3>
<p>This smoked chicken breast recipe is a delicious and different way to enjoy chicken breasts, with plenty of smoky flavors. Brining the chicken before smoking allows it to stay moist and flavorful. They are a great addition to a salad, on a sandwich, or by themselves!</p>
<br>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts</li>
  <li>maple wood chips</li>
  <li>4 cups water</li>
  <li>Â¼ cup kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>

  <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
  <li>Make brine: Combine water, kosher salt, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar in a large bowl. Stir until salt and brown sugar are dissolved. Place chicken breasts into brine, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.</li>
  <li>Preheat an electric smoker according to manufacturer's directions to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) using maple wood chips.</li>
  <li>Remove chicken breasts from brine and rinse under cold water. Pat dry and set aside.</li>
  <li>Make rub: Combine brown sugar, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. Sprinkle dry rub all over chicken breasts and place skin-side up on a grill rack in the preheated smoker. Place a drip pan underneath.</li>
  <li>Smoke chicken breasts in the preheated smoker until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 4 hours, adding maple wood chips as necessary to keep the smoke continuous. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
