<h3>World's Best Stuffed Peppers</h3>
<p>Stuffed peppers with ground beef and rice are topped with a seasoned tomato sauce.</p>
<br>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup cold water</li>
  <li>Â½ cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
  <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
  <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
  <li>16 ounces tomato sauce, divided</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
 <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
 <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
 <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
 <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
